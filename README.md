Categorical Bayesian Network Inference

Catnet is a R package for structure learning and parameter estimation of discrete Bayesian networks using likelihood-based criteria. 
It implements a dynamic programming algorithm for exhaustive search across networks with a given node order and stochastic search 
of optimal node orders via simulated annealing algorithm.
